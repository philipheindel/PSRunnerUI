# ScriptRunnerUI


## About the project
The basic purpose of this application is to allow for the execution of scripts by those who are more comfortable with a point-and-click GUI than a command line. Initially it was just supposed to be for Powershell scripts, but then the scope was expanded to include CMD and VB scripts as well. If it is not obvious yet, this is primarily oriented towards Windows systems. There is no reason why this could not also be built for MacOS or any flavor of Linux, and anyone wanting to create such a thing is welcome to do so.
